# Cassandra Migration for Fantasy Game Application

## 🎯 Project Overview

This repository contains a complete migration strategy and implementation for moving a Fantasy Game application from PostgreSQL to Apache Cassandra. The migration is designed to achieve **10x scalability**, **sub-50ms latency**, and **linear horizontal scaling** for a high-performance gaming workload.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

- Apache Cassandra 4.0+ cluster (6+ nodes recommended)
- Network topology with 2+ data centers
- Sufficient hardware: 32GB RAM, 8+ CPU cores per node
- SSD storage for optimal performance

### 2. Deployment Steps

```bash
# 1. Create keyspace and basic settings
cqlsh -f 00_cassandra_keyspace_and_optimization.cql

# 2. Create master data tables
cqlsh -f 01_cassandra_master_data_tables.cql

# 3. Create user and gameplay tables
cqlsh -f 02_cassandra_user_gameplay_tables.cql

# 4. Create time-series and analytics tables
cqlsh -f 03_cassandra_time_series_stats_tables.cql

# 5. Create leaderboard and social features tables
cqlsh -f 04_cassandra_leaderboard_league_tables.cql

# 6. Apply production optimizations (see optimization file for examples)
```

### 3. Validation

```cql
-- Verify keyspace creation
DESCRIBE KEYSPACE fantasy_game;

-- Check table count (should be ~68 tables)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM system_schema.tables WHERE keyspace_name = 'fantasy_game';

-- Test basic operations
SELECT * FROM sports LIMIT 5;
SELECT * FROM devices LIMIT 5;
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Query-First Design Philosophy

Every table is designed around specific query patterns identified from the API documentation:

- **User Sessions**: Direct lookup by `source_id` and `user_guid`
- **Game Summaries**: Single partition reads for all user teams
- **Leaderboards**: Pre-computed rankings for O(1) retrieval
- **Player Stats**: Time-series data with latest-first clustering

### Strategic Denormalization

**Before (PostgreSQL)**:
```sql
-- Complex JOIN with window functions
WITH latest_teams AS (
  SELECT utd.*, ut.team_name,
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (...) AS rn
  FROM user_team_detail utd
  JOIN user_teams ut ON ...
) SELECT * FROM latest_teams WHERE rn = 1;
```

**After (Cassandra)**:
```cql
-- Single partition read
SELECT * FROM user_team_latest 
WHERE season_id = ? AND partition_id = ? AND user_id = ?;
```

### Intelligent Partitioning Strategy

1. **Season-Based Partitioning**: Distributes load across active seasons
2. **User-Based Partitioning**: Maintains existing user segmentation
3. **Time-Based Partitioning**: Optimizes for time-series queries
4. **League-Type Partitioning**: Scales social features independently

## 📊 Performance Targets

| Metric | PostgreSQL | Cassandra Target | Improvement |
|--------|------------|------------------|-------------|
| Read Latency (P95) | 200ms | 50ms | **4x faster** |
| Write Latency (P95) | 150ms | 30ms | **5x faster** |
| Throughput | 2,000 ops/sec | 15,000 ops/sec | **7.5x higher** |
| Scalability | Vertical only | Linear horizontal | **∞x scaling** |
| Availability | 99.5% | 99.9% | **4x better** |

## 📈 Scaling Characteristics

### Horizontal Scaling
```
Users:        100K → 1M → 10M
Nodes:        3 → 6 → 18
Latency:      Constant (no degradation)
Throughput:   Linear increase
```

### Data Growth
```
Season 1:     100GB
Season 10:    1TB
Season 100:   10TB
Performance:  Maintained through partitioning
```

## 🛡️ Anti-Pattern Avoidance

### ❌ What We Avoided

1. **Unbounded Partitions**: All partitions have natural size limits
2. **Hot Partitions**: Even distribution across partition keys
3. **Excessive Indexing**: Query-first design eliminates secondary indexes
4. **Large Writes**: Batch sizes optimized for performance
5. **Cross-Partition Queries**: Single-partition reads for critical paths

### ✅ Best Practices Implemented

1. **Composite Keys**: Multi-dimensional data access
2. **TTL Usage**: Automatic cleanup for transient data
3. **Compression**: Optimal storage efficiency
4. **Compaction Tuning**: Workload-specific strategies
5. **Connection Pooling**: Efficient resource utilization

## 🔧 Operational Excellence

### Monitoring Stack
- **Metrics**: Latency, throughput, error rates
- **Alerting**: Proactive issue detection
- **Dashboards**: Real-time operational visibility
- **Logging**: Centralized error tracking

### Backup Strategy
- **Frequency**: Daily incremental, weekly full
- **Retention**: 30 days local, 90 days remote
- **Recovery**: Point-in-time restoration
- **Testing**: Monthly recovery drills

### Security Measures
- **Authentication**: Role-based access control
- **Encryption**: TLS for transit, AES for rest
- **Network**: VPC isolation and security groups
- **Auditing**: Complete access logging
